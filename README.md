# Pitch-classification
This project seeks to, given a number of variables describing each pitch, identify the pitch types of the unknown pitches in a test set. With the advent of PITCHF/x data, this classification problem has become automatable, and thus is being widely explored within the MLB, both by the league for its broadcasts and statistics as well as by teams, presumably to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of pitchers and hitters throwing or facing the different pitch types. The datasets used contain PITCHF/x information from several thousand pitches from a variety of pitchers over different seasons. The columns include the pitch ID, pitcher ID, season, pitcher handedness, pitcher height, initial pitch speed as it leaves the pitcher's hand, horizontal and vertical break distance, coordinates identifying the release point of the pitch, distance from the rubber at which the pitch was released, and the spin rate.
